                <p>Apart from the money you are
                    saving from reduced fuel usage and lower maintenance
                    costs, you are helping with saving the planet also. A
                    battery EV emits zero carbon emissions, which in turn
                    contributes to the fight of climate change and
                    improving air quality within cities.</p>

                <h3 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Regenerative Braking</h3>
                <p>When you brake an electric
                    vehicle, the vehicleâ€™s engine switches into reverse
                    mode, allowing for the resulting heat to be converted
                    into energy. That energy then is directed back into the
                    battery of the EV, repowering the car with some amount
                    of the energy it lost.</p>

                <h3 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Fuel Saving</h3>
                <p>All EVs use electricity at
                    least partially to power their engines, this means EVs
                    are
                    reducing the dependence on non-renewable energy sources
                    and in turn enhancing energy security.</p>
